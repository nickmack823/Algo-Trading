Metric Explanations for Backtest Run Analysis
-----------------------------------------------

1. Timeframe:
   - Meaning: The granularity of the data used for the backtest (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 day). It determines the frequency of trade signals.
   - Example: A "1 day" timeframe means that the strategy uses daily data, generating signals based on each day’s price movements.

2. Data_Start_Date:
   - Meaning: The starting date of the historical data used for the backtest.
   - Example: If Data_Start_Date is "2020-01-01", the backtest begins on January 1, 2020.

3. Data_End_Date:
   - Meaning: The ending date of the historical data used for the backtest.
   - Example: If Data_End_Date is "2020-12-31", the backtest concludes on December 31, 2020.

4. Total_Trades:
   - Meaning: The total number of trades executed during the backtest run.
   - Example: A Total_Trades value of 100 means the strategy executed 100 trades over the testing period.

5. Winning_Trades:
   - Meaning: The number of trades that resulted in a profit.
   - Example: If Winning_Trades is 60, then 60 out of 100 trades were profitable.

6. Gross_Profit:
   - Meaning: The sum of all profits from winning trades, before subtracting losses.
   - Example: A Gross_Profit of $5,000 indicates that winning trades, combined, earned $5,000.

7. Gross_Loss:
   - Meaning: The sum of all losses from losing trades (usually a negative number).
   - Example: A Gross_Loss of -$3,000 shows that losing trades resulted in a total loss of $3,000.

8. Net_Profit:
   - Meaning: The overall profit or loss, calculated as Final_Balance minus Initial_Balance.
   - Example: A Net_Profit of $2,000 means that after all trades, the account grew by $2,000 from its starting balance.

9. Total_Return_Pct:
   - Meaning: The percentage return over the backtest period, computed as (Net_Profit / Initial_Balance) * 100.
   - Example: A Total_Return_Pct of 20% indicates the account increased by 20% relative to the initial balance.

10. Win_Rate:
    - Meaning: The ratio of winning trades to total trades.
    - Example: A Win_Rate of 0.60 (or 60%) means that 60% of the trades were winners.

11. Profit_Factor:
    - Meaning: The ratio of Gross_Profit to the absolute value of Gross_Loss, indicating the return for each unit of loss.
    - Example: A Profit_Factor of 1.67 suggests that for every $1 lost, $1.67 was earned.

12. Max_Drawdown:
    - Meaning: The largest drop from a peak balance during the run, measuring worst-case loss scenarios.
    - Example: A Max_Drawdown of $500 means the account experienced a peak-to-trough decline of $500 at its worst.

13. Average_Trade_Duration_Minutes:
    - Meaning: The average time (in minutes) that trades remain open.
    - Example: An Average_Trade_Duration_Minutes of 45 means that, on average, each trade was held for 45 minutes.

14. Initial_Balance:
    - Meaning: The starting account balance at the beginning of the backtest.
    - Example: An Initial_Balance of $10,000 is the baseline capital for the simulation.

15. Final_Balance:
    - Meaning: The ending account balance at the close of the backtest.
    - Example: A Final_Balance of $12,000 indicates that the account grew to $12,000 after all trades.

16. Sharpe_Ratio:
    - Meaning: A risk-adjusted performance metric calculated as the average trade return divided by the standard deviation of returns. It indicates return per unit of total volatility.
    - Example: A Sharpe_Ratio of 1.5 suggests that the strategy's returns are 1.5 times its volatility; higher is typically better.

17. Sortino_Ratio:
    - Meaning: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but considers only downside volatility (negative returns), offering a measure of risk-adjusted performance that penalizes harmful fluctuations.
    - Example: A Sortino_Ratio of 2.0 implies the strategy performs well when only negative volatility is considered.

18. Calmar_Ratio:
    - Meaning: The ratio of net profit to maximum drawdown, indicating how much profit is earned per unit of drawdown risk.
    - Example: A Calmar_Ratio of 3.0 means that for every dollar of drawdown, the strategy generated $3 in profit.

19. Recovery_Factor:
    - Meaning: Calculated as net profit divided by maximum drawdown; it reflects the strategy's ability to recover from losses.
    - Example: A Recovery_Factor of 2.5 indicates that the net profit is 2.5 times the worst drawdown, showing strong recovery potential.

20. Win_Loss_Ratio:
    - Meaning: The ratio of the average profit from winning trades to the average loss from losing trades, providing insight into the risk/reward profile.
    - Example: A Win_Loss_Ratio of 1.8 means that winning trades, on average, are 1.8 times as profitable as losing trades are costly.

21. Trade_Expectancy_Pct:
    - Meaning: The expected percentage return per trade, calculated as (Win_Rate × Average Win (%) - ((1 - Win_Rate) × |Average Loss (%)|)). It provides a normalized measure of profitability per trade relative to the account balance.
    - Example: A value of 2% indicates that, on average, each trade contributes a 2% return.

22. Trade_Return_Std:
    - Meaning: The standard deviation of individual trade returns, measuring the variability in trade performance.
    - Example: A Trade_Return_Std of 0.02 (or 2%) indicates that the returns typically deviate by about 2 percentage points from the average.

23. Trades_Per_Day:
    - Meaning: The average number of trades executed per day during the backtest period, normalizing trading activity.
    - Example: If Trades_Per_Day is 1.5, it suggests that, on average, between 1 and 2 trades were executed each day.

24. Max_Consecutive_Wins:
    - Meaning: The highest number of winning trades in a row during the run.
    - Example: A value of 5 means there was a streak of 5 consecutive winning trades, which may boost confidence but also indicate potential risk if expectations are too high.

25. Max_Consecutive_Losses:
    - Meaning: The highest number of losing trades in a row during the run.
    - Example: A value of 4 indicates that at one point the strategy experienced 4 losses in a row, highlighting potential drawdown risk and psychological strain.

26. Max_Pct_Margin_Required:
    - Meaning: The maximum percentage of the account balance required as margin for any trade, showing peak capital usage and liquidity risk.
    - Example: If Max_Pct_Margin_Required is 15%, it means that the largest trade required 15% of the account balance as margin, which is critical for evaluating risk exposure.

Overall, these metrics and their interpretations help you assess not only the profitability but also the risk profile, consistency, and capital efficiency of your trading strategies. They provide a comprehensive framework for comparing strategies and determining which might be optimal for live trading.
